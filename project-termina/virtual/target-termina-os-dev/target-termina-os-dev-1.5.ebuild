# The dependencies here are meant to capture "all the packages
# developers want to use for development, test, or debug".  This
# category is meant to include all developer use cases, including
# software test and debug, performance tuning, hardware validation,
# and debugging failures running autotest.
#
# To protect developer images from changes in other ebuilds you
# should include any package with a user constituency, regardless of
# whether that package is included in the base Chromium OS image or
# any other ebuild.
#
# Don't include packages that are indirect dependencies: only
# include a package if a file *in that package* is expected to be
# useful.
