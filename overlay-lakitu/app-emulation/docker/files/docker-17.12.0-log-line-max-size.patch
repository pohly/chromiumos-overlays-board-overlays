Subject: [PATCH] Change Docker log line max size to 100kB

(From https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/744310 )

Start from docker-1.13, Docker added a limit that the max size for one
log line is 16k. And log entries longer than 16k will be split to
multiple lines. This breaks some COS users using Stackdriver because of
the fragmented log lines and broken jsons. This CL increases the max size
for one log line from 16k to 100k so it aligns with Stackdriver limit:
https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas.

BUG=b:65671098
TEST=Ran instance locally and verified log entry split to lines when size > 100k
RELEASE_NOTE=Increase Docker log line max size from 16KB to 100kB
