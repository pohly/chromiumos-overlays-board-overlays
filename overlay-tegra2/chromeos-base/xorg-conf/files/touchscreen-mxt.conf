# Calibrates the X and Y axes for devices that need to scale to a different
# coordinate system than reported to the X server. This feature is required for
# devices that need to scale to a different coordinate system than originally
# reported by the kernel (e.g. touchscreens). The scaling to the custom
# coordinate system is done in-driver and the X server is unaware of the
# transformation.
