# The tarball for this package was created from this repo:
#     https://github.com/beagleboard/kernel.git
# That repo is a collection of patches, plus a script to apply them
# to a linux kernel.
#
# The specific set of patches came from commit 8a908ca, on a branch
# named "3.8"; that commit was tip of tree on July 17, when this
# snapshot was taken.  The patches were applied against Linux kernel
# version 3.8.13.
#
# The config file for the kernel was based on the config provided
# with the beagleboard repo, with selected changes made to meet
# Chrome OS config preferences.
#
# This package is in a private overlay for now for the sake of
# keeping "am335x-pm-firmware.bin" private.
#
# TODO(jrbarnette):  Really, we want to eliminate this ebuild
# altogether, and rely on the standard Chromium OS kernel ebuild.
